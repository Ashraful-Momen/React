- **React** = What your UI is (components, state, logic).  
- **React DOM** = Where your UI appears (the browser’s DOM).  
- **Babel** = How your modern JavaScript gets understood by older browsers (transpiles JSX and ES6+ → browser-friendly JS).  
- **Webpack** = How your code, styles, and assets get bundled into optimized files for the browser (module bundler).  
- **Virtual DOM** = React’s lightweight copy of the real DOM—used to efficiently update only what changed (performance booster).
