- **React** = What your UI is (components, state, logic).  
- **React DOM** = Where your UI appears (the browser’s DOM).  
- **Babel** = How your modern JavaScript gets understood by older browsers (transpiles JSX and ES6+ → browser-friendly JS).  
- **Webpack** = How your code, styles, and assets get bundled into optimized files for the browser (module bundler).  
- **Virtual DOM** = React’s lightweight copy of the real DOM—used to efficiently update only what changed (performance booster).

# React Ecosystem - Short Note

**React** = Your UI components, state, and logic  
**React DOM** = Renders React to the browser's DOM  
**Babel** = Transpiles JSX/ES6+ → Browser-compatible JS  
**Webpack** = Bundles code/assets(css,js) for production  
**Virtual DOM** = React's performance engine (efficient updates)

**Flow**:  
`React Components` → `Babel` → `Webpack` → `React DOM` → `Virtual DOM` → `Real DOM`

**Simple**: React builds UI, tools make it browser-ready! 🚀


**Remember**: Virtual DOM → Diffing → Reconciliation → DOM Update 🚀
