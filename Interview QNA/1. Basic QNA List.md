### 🔹 **Core React Concepts**

**Q1: What is React?**  
**A:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable, declarative components. It focuses on the "view" layer and uses a virtual DOM for efficient updates.

---

**Q2: What’s the difference between React and React DOM?**  
**A:**  
- **React** contains core functionality (components, hooks, state logic).  
- **React DOM** handles rendering those components into the browser DOM.  
> *React is platform-agnostic; React DOM is web-specific.*

---

**Q3: What is JSX?**  
**A:** JSX is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript. It gets transpiled by Babel into `React.createElement()` calls.

---

**Q4: What is the Virtual DOM? How does it work?**  
**A:**  
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. When state changes:  
1. React creates a new Virtual DOM tree.  
2. Compares it with the previous one (diffing).  
3. Updates only the changed parts in the real DOM (reconciliation).  
→ This minimizes expensive DOM operations.

---

### 🔹 **Components & State**

**Q5: What are the types of components in React?**  
**A:**  
- **Functional Components**: Simple functions (with hooks for state/logic). Preferred in modern React.  
- **Class Components**: ES6 classes (older pattern, uses lifecycle methods).

---

**Q6: What are React Hooks? Name a few.**  
**A:** Hooks let you use state and side effects in functional components. Common ones:  
- `useState` → manage local state  
- `useEffect` → handle side effects (API calls, subscriptions)  
- `useContext` → access context  
- `useRef` → reference DOM elements or mutable values

---

**Q7: What is the difference between state and props?**  
**A:**  
- **Props**: Read-only inputs passed from parent to child (immutable).  
- **State**: Mutable data managed within a component (triggers re-renders when changed).

---

### 🔹 **Rendering & Lifecycle**

**Q8: Explain React’s rendering process.**  
**A:**  
1. Component returns JSX.  
2. JSX → Virtual DOM elements.  
3. React reconciles changes vs. previous Virtual DOM.  
4. Efficiently updates real DOM via React DOM.

---

**Q9: What is StrictMode?**  
**A:** A development tool that highlights potential problems (e.g., unsafe lifecycles, legacy APIs). It **only runs in development** and doesn’t affect production.

---

### 🔹 **Build & Tooling**

**Q10: Why do we need Babel in a React app?**  
**A:** Babel transpiles modern JavaScript (ES6+, JSX) into backward-compatible code so older browsers can run it.

---

**Q11: What does Webpack do in a React project?**  
**A:** Webpack bundles all modules (JS, CSS, images) into optimized static assets. It enables features like code splitting, hot reloading, and asset management.

---

### 🔹 **Performance & Best Practices**

**Q12: How can you optimize React performance?**  
**A:**  
- Use `React.memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  
- Use `useCallback`/`useMemo` to cache functions/values.  
- Code splitting with `React.lazy` + `Suspense`.  
- Avoid inline object/function definitions in render.

---

**Q13: What is key prop and why is it important?**  
**A:** The `key` prop helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed in lists. It ensures efficient re-rendering and preserves component state.

---

### 🔹 **Bonus: Modern React**

**Q14: What is the difference between `ReactDOM.render()` and `createRoot()`?**  
**A:**  
- `ReactDOM.render()` → Legacy (React 17 and earlier).  
- `createRoot()` → New concurrent root API (React 18+), enables features like automatic batching and Suspense SSR.

---

**Q15: What is React Fiber?**  
**A:** React’s new reconciliation engine (introduced in React 16) that enables incremental rendering, prioritization, and better performance for animations, gestures, and large updates.

---

✅ **Pro Tip**: Always explain **“why”**, not just “what.”  
Example: *“We use keys in lists so React can efficiently update the DOM without re-rendering the entire list.”*
